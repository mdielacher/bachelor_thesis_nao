# Speech-to-Text-Dialog with ChatGPT
This project enables a dialog with ChatGPT using speech recognition technology. It combines the Speech-to-Text system's ability to convert spoken language into text with ChatGPT, a large language model that can respond to natural language.

## Requirements:
To run the script, the following requirements are needed:

- A computer or laptop with sufficient capability.
- A microphone or audio system capable of recording speech.
- A working Internet for communication with the ChatGPT API.
- The installation of the required Python packages and dependencies. The exact dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Installation:
It is recommended to create a Virtual Environment for this script to have an isolated environment for the dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up the script:

- In your terminal or command line, navigate to the directory of the cloned repository
- Create a virtual environment with the command: **python3 -m venv myenv**
- Activate the virtual environment: **WINDOWS: myenv\Scripts\activate** // **MacOS: source myenv/bin/activate**
- Install the required Python packages and dependencies with the following command: **pip install -r requirements.txt**

## Usage: 
- Make sure that the virtual environment is enabled.
- Open a terminal or command line and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
- Run the script with the command: **python script.py**
- The script will use the microphone to record your speech and convert it to text.
- Type your question or message loudly and clearly into the microphone.
- The script sends the recognized text to the ChatGPT API and receives a response, which is also converted to speech and played through the speakers.

**HAVE FUN !**
